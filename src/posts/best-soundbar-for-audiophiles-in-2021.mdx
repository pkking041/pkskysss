  ### **Things you need to consider before buying a soundbar**


  Instead of knowing how to buy a perfect soundbar, you can simply look at the following considerations to choose the right one for yourself. 


  To have quick considerations keep several things in your mind, including your TV size, to adjust the soundbar accordingly without dwarfing the TV screen and having an awkward cruise and small ship size scenario. 


  In the era of advancements, soundbars have boosted wireless subwoofers, wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Apple Airplay, Spotify), and wired connections (optical cables, HDMI ARC, USB ports). 


  Moreover, these soundbars support Dolby Atmos (surround sound system to project audio or sound all around). Although the features mentioned above (that you should always look at before buying a soundbar), consider the following to have even precise knowledge. 


  ### **More channels** 


  Channels are speakers added within the soundbar; thus, the more channels, the more clear and crisp your audio will be. 


  However, depending on other factors, you might compromise on the lower one and make sure that the soundbar has three channels.


  On the other hand, Dolby Atmos (five to seven channels) integration will make your audio experience better alone. 


  ### **An active soundbar**


  Among passive (with no built-in power amplifiers) and active (with built-in power amplifiers) soundbars, you should choose active if you simply want a TV audio upgrade. 


  Select passive soundbar if you use it for custom installations, for instance, to have Dolby Atmos with the soundbar’s disappearance with TV. 


  ### **Soundbar placement**


  The only two places where you can install your soundbar includes the upper wall and lower shelf (of TV). 


  Therefore, select a reasonably sized soundbar that can either easily mount above the TV or placed below the TV without a strange look. 


   


  *By carefully understanding the considerations mentioned above, you can easily get a perfect soundbar for your audiophilic needs.* 


   


  *Now, let’s see what people are asking about soundbars!*
