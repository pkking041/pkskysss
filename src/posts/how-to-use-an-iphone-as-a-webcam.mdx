beforebody: "These days, not just you but a lot of people looking for ways to
  save money from buying an expensive webcam, and why shouldn’t it be? Because a
  regular webcam comes minimum in the price range of 50 to 80 bucks. Not all of
  us are willing to pay that much to attend some zoom meetings or online
  classes.\r

  \r

  Here we have found the best option that is less expensive and gives a better
  quality than a regular webcam.\r

  \r

  All you need to have to use an iPhone as a webcam, an iPhone mobile, or iPad
  with a working camera; front or back both work fine. However, we recommend the
  back camera as you know it is considered the main camera of a phone. You will
  need these things also, 1.an Epocam app, install it on your mobile phone, 2.
  kinoni driver on your PC.  \r

  \r

  Let’s straight dive into the guide and see how to make this possible.\r

  Things that are required.\r

  \r

  Epoccam app, download from the ios app store on your phone or tablet.\r

  Visit Kinoni’s website to download drivers for epocam on your PC, Windows,
  or Mac. \r

  Epocam app for iphone\r

  \r

  It is an application for connecting your iPhone camera to your computer. It
  comes in two versions; Free or paid. As you can guess, the difference already,
  a free one has some ads inside the app, and the paid one is entirely free,
  which means no ads. It costs around 8$ per month, I guess.\r

  Driver for your computer\r

  \r

  It’s a driver you must have to download on your PC to run the app. Without
  this, the app wouldn’t work. However, You might already be familiar with how a
  driver works-it adds some files into a computer to support external devices.
  And for connecting, there are two ways, either use a cord or wireless
  connection. By the way, using the cord instead of wireless will give you a
  better experience, for the reason that a wireless connection often gets
  interrupted.\r

  how to use an iPhone as a webcam (Step by Step guide)\r

  Just follow the images with the steps showing in there. You will find it a
  lot easier than you might’ve expected it to be. Let’s get to it!\r

  \r

  Install Epocam App\r

  \r

  The first thing comes first, head over to the app store and search for
  “Epocam app.” You will see two different apps icons with the same name as
  we’ve told about them earlier. Choose and choose which one you would like to
  use. The app with the green Icon is free so expect some ads inside it, and the
  red icon is the pro version with no ads, preferably the best choice is there
  to go with the premium version, 8$ is not much expensive if you think you will
  go longer with this process. Anyways after downloading it, and leave it unopen
  for now.\r

  Download drivers on your PC\r

  \r

  \r

  Visit the website. The link is mentioned above. You will land on a page
  similar to that showing in the image. Next, click on the left side box, scroll
  down and choose the app. Obviously, in this case, you will need to select the
  epocam. Secondly, from the right box, choose the operating system of your
  computer. Click to Download button a little down you can see, and the file
  automatically gets into your PC. What to do with this? Let’s see in the next
  step. By the way, we will be using here the Mac OS.\r

  Install it on your system\r

  \r

  When you get the file on your computer, navigate to the folder where it is
  located. Most often, it will show on your download folder, so first check
  there; it will save you time to looking around for the file. So Once you catch
  the file, click on it, it will ask you to install it to use it, do it. The
  process is going to be much easier, simple as just you will to click on the
  next steps, agree with the terms, and put your password if asked to get it
  done. At this moment, you’re almost done, so don’t lose focus. There are just
  a few more clicks left to go.\r

  Use a Cord to connect your mobile and computer.\r

  \r

  It’s time to cook the recipe as we have all the ingredients already on our
  hands. In order to connect your iPhone to your pc, you will need to have a
  data cable. It is like putting your mobile on the charge where your system is
  the power supply. \r

  \r

  However, there is another way to do this; using wireless connectivity. If
  you want to go with this method, turn on the hotspot from your iPhone and let
  your system catch the network by turning on the wifi, write down your password
  and you’re ready to go. It’s no more different than connecting a wifi
  network.\r

  \r

  At this stage, your system should be linked to your phone’s camera. Try
  opening the app that we’ve installed on our first step. A word of advice,
  don’t mess around any settings. For now, use it on its default settings.\r

  Set the maximum camera resolution\r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  When you open up the app, the camera will automatically get turned on, and
  at the same moment, your pc will catch the screen with the camera opened up
  just as you’re using a webcam.\r

  \r

  However, by using the app> go to settings just for increasing the
  resolutions. Keep it high as it could be, some advanced options will be
  showing there like switching camera back to front is also doable. For a better
  experience, place your mobile camera-positioned at the best place possible,
  that is on the top of your system.\r

  \r

  Take advantage of your new unique webcam, attend zoom meetings, take online
  classes. There is nothing to worry about. \r

  Tips\r

  Unlike using a webcam, when you connect your phone’s camera to a webcam,
  there are a few best practices to follow up.\r

  \r

  Like always, turn on airplane mode, so no one can call you when you’re in a
  meeting. Otherwise, the connection might break, or the worst, the caller ID,
  will be shown to the people watching your streaming.\r

  \r

  Secondly, always keep the screen time to maximum, because if you don’t do
  that, the mobile screen will automatically turn off as usual, and the webcam
  will also get black. It’s the essential thing to do after finishing up the
  settings.\r\n"
