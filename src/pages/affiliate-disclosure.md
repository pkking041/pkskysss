# Amazon Affiliate Disclosure

Obviously, we have to cover our research and survey expenses, so for that purpose we have registered ourselves with Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. This is an affiliate program that allows us to make little commission. Hence, this is the only source for us to run this research work efficiently for all our visitors.

So as a good will gesture, we expect that you buy from our links, so we can get commission for that and there is no additional cost for you. So just for our motivation and appreciation buy from our given product links and we get commission from Amazon Associate Program.
